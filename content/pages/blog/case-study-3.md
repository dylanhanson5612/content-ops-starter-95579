## Project Overview

The McLean Estate is a 24,000 square foot modern wonder that brings the Veritas Builders philosophy of sustainable luxury to one of the Regions most coveted neighborhoods. Set on 1.1 acres — a rare find in the suburban landscape — this home is a masterclass in making the most of a premium location.

## Highlights

**Granite & Glass Facade** — The street-facing elevation features a dramatic combination of honed natural stone panels and triple-pane insulated glass. The material palette establishes a commanding presence while meeting the architectural standards of the historic neighborhood.

**Rooftop Solar System** — A discreet 20kW solar panel installation sits flush with the flat roof sections, invisible from street level. Combined with a high-efficiency HVAC system and superior insulation, the home achieves exceptional energy performance.

**Courtyard Garden** — The center of the home wraps around a private courtyard garden accessible from the living room, dining room, and primary suite. Custom bluestone pavers, a reflecting pool, specimen Japanese maples, and integrated landscape lighting create a serene urban oasis.

**Hardscape & Entry** — The front approach features a heated bluestone walkway, a custom steel-and-glass entry canopy, and low stone walls topped with integrated planters. A rear terrace with an outdoor kitchen overlooks the sloped rear garden with a series of stone-walled garden rooms.

**Precision Site Work** — Building on a sloped urban lot required careful excavation, underpinning of neighboring structures, and installation of an engineered retaining wall system. The result is multiple levels of usable outdoor space that feel naturally integrated with the topography.
