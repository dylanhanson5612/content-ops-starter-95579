## Highlights

**Natural Stone Facade** — The exterior features hand-selected Pennsylvania bluestone arranged in a modern ashlar pattern, creating a striking contrast against floor-to-ceiling glass panels. The stone wraps the main entry tower and extends along the east wing, grounding the home in natural materials.

**Solar Integration** — A 15kW solar panel system is seamlessly integrated into the standing-seam metal roof, generating enough clean energy to power the home year-round. The system includes battery storage for energy independence during peak demand.

**Glass & Light** — Every room in this 3-story home has natural light beaming in at every angle. What was a closed off home now features stunning sunshine at all hours of the day with minimal interior lighting use.

**Landscape & Hardscape** — The grounds include a permeable paver stone driveway, heated outdoor living pavilion, native pollinator gardens, and a natural stone retaining wall system that follows the gentle slope of the property.

**Site Work** — Extensive grading and underground rainwater collection systems were installed to protect the property and surrounding watershed. A permeable paver driveway and bio-retention areas handle runoff naturally.
