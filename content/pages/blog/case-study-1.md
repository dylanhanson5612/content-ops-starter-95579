## Project Overview

The Kensington Estate is a stunning 6,500 square foot modern residence situated on 2 acres in one of Bethesda's most prestigious neighborhoods. This home represents the pinnacle of sustainable luxury, combining cutting-edge green technology with timeless architectural design.

## Highlights

**Natural Stone Facade** — The exterior features hand-selected Pennsylvania bluestone arranged in a modern ashlar pattern, creating a striking contrast against floor-to-ceiling glass panels. The stone wraps the main entry tower and extends along the east wing, grounding the home in natural materials.

**Solar Integration** — A 15kW solar panel system is seamlessly integrated into the standing-seam metal roof, generating enough clean energy to power the home year-round. The system includes battery storage for energy independence during peak demand.

**Glass & Light** — The rear elevation features a 24-foot-tall glass curtain wall that floods the great room with natural light and provides uninterrupted views of the landscaped backyard, mature hardwoods, and a custom stone patio with outdoor kitchen.

**Landscape & Hardscape** — The grounds include a circular stone driveway, formal entry courtyard, heated outdoor living pavilion, native pollinator gardens, and a natural stone retaining wall system that follows the gentle slope of the property.

**Site Work** — Extensive grading and stormwater management systems were installed to protect the property and surrounding watershed. A permeable paver driveway and bio-retention areas handle runoff naturally.
