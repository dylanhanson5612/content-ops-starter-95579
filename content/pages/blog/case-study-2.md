## Project Overview

The Middleburg Modern is a 7,200 square foot contemporary farmhouse that redefines luxury living in Virginia's horse country. Set on 3.5 acres of rolling terrain, this home bridges the gap between the region's agricultural heritage and forward-thinking sustainable design.

## Highlights

**Reclaimed Stone & Modern Lines** — The exterior pairs reclaimed Virginia fieldstone from a 19th-century barn with clean modern lines and dark metal cladding. The contrast creates an aesthetic that respects the area's rural character while making a bold contemporary statement.

**Floor-to-Ceiling Glass Gallery** — A 40-foot glass gallery hallway connects the main living wing to the guest suite, framing views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and creating a light-filled art display space.

**Solar & Geothermal** — A 20kW solar array combined with a geothermal heat pump system makes this home net-zero energy. The home produces more energy than it consumes annually, with surplus energy fed back to the grid.

**Resort-Style Grounds** — The landscape design includes a natural swimming pool with regenerative filtration, stone terraces at multiple levels, a fire pit gathering area built with native stone, and extensive native meadow plantings that support local wildlife.

**Site Work Excellence** — Given the rolling terrain, precision grading and a comprehensive drainage system were critical. The team preserved over 30 mature trees while creating level building pads, a sweeping gravel approach drive, and a stone motor court.
